# USING BIOINFORMATICS TO GENERATE TESTABLE PREDICTIONS

## PART I

### THE LARGER CONTEXT

- Scope and limits of the bioinformatics approaches
- How to maximize the benefit of the bioinformatics approach

### FOCUSING ON A DISEASE/CONDITION

- OMIM
- Monogenic vs complex diseases
- Epidemiological considerations

### FOCUSING ON A GENE

- Is the gene relevant for the disease?

	- OMIM

- Where and when is the gene expressed?

	- general and dedicated databases
	- developmenatal databases

- Does the loss of function animal model have a phenotype?

	- mouse MGI

- Is the 3D structure resolved?

	- PDB

### FOCUSING ON nsSNP OCCURING IN A GENE OF INTEREST

- diagram with the possible sources of variation
- why nsSNPs?
- Retrieving information from SNP databases

	- dbSNP
	- ClinVar
	- DisGeNet

## PART II

### EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF A nsSNP

- Predicting a deleterious effect

	- SnpEff

- Identifying categories of interest

	- Conserved SNPs

		- UCSC Browser

	- Regulatory SNPs

		- ENCODE

	- SNPs in protein domains

		- PFAM

- Evaluate the impact of the substitution on the 3D structure of a protein

	- PDB

- Integrative evaluation

	- Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor

- Selecting the final candidate SNP set

## PART III

### DESIGNING FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATIONS

- Biological experiments
- Further bioinformatics investigations

### CONCLUSIONS
